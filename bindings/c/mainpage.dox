/**
@mainpage Intecture API - C Binding Documentation

The Intecture API C binding consists of a set of headers. See inapi.h
for more information.

To build an Intecture C project, you should include the C header
(inapi.h) in your code and link against the Rust dynamic library at
compile time (-l inapi).
